# Jira ticket ID copy
This is a dummy Firefox extension that just attempts to find the Jira ticket ID from the URL and copy it to the clipboard.
The ticket ID must exist in the URL when the extension icon is clicked (or when the shortcut keys are pressed), otherwise nothing gets copied to the clipborad.
